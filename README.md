Objective:
The goal of the project is to help myself become more familiar with the electronics design process. This includes:
* Schematic Design
* Component Selection
* PCB Layout
* Initial Board Bring-Up and Verification
* Firmware Development
* Evaluate Rust in an embedded microcontroller application

Plan
Build a PCB project with a similar purpose to a manufacturer evalutation kit with the following requirements:
* Bluetooth connectivity
* IO available with _reasonable_ function through peripherals
* Connectible to PC using USB-C
* Logging through UART when connected to PC

Conclusion:
The board design was completed and peer reviewed (by coworker)
Samples were ordered through PCB way and digikey for components
Samples were hand assembled (with blood sweat and tears)
Issue in the inline fuse, replaced with 0R resistor to advance in design
Board is functional, able to program and toggle LED using available IO
Bluetooth connectivity is pending..
